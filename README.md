# fe-fi-faux-forum

DEAR NEDA OR MICHAL: please ignore the first few commits because Will and I were uploading the last challenge as a base so the 120,000+ creations and deletions shouldn't be taken into account

a mockup of a forum-type message board to be used with NodeJS

Planned functionality includes:
  - account login/creation
  - board posting
  - admin accounts that can delete posts

please make a branch when adding/trying new functionality
